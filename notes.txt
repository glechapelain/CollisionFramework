Dear Students,

I haven't fully tested the contact point yet, but will put that online now if you already want to start on the assignment:
I will confirm and had to the code to display tomorrow.

At the very end of the function `segmentCollisionCheck()', (~Line 722-732) when 
 o we collide
 o the normal is set
 o the contact point is set 
(^ As discussed in course: the method is loose so I have try to make it most fool-proof)

I set the velocity of the two rigid bodies to their opposite (Line 728-732)

 (both linear & angular)

Obviously, this isn't correct. (It looks good sometimes but in most cases it isn't correct.)

Your mission is to fill the equation for v1_prime, v2_prime, w1_prime & w2_prime (Line 722-736) as we have seen in classes
(material online, or the wikipedia page.)

And then, it *will* look all good!

Do not hesitate to reach out if you have question on using the Math operation we have in the current code
